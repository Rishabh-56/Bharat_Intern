# Bharat_Intern
This Repo is made for the purpose of the completion of my Bharat_Intern Internship on Machine Learning. I have worked on two project to showcase my knowledge
in the field of Machine Learning. 
I have worked on two projects, first is "Flower iris classification" and "house sale prediction".
"Flower iris Classification":
                             I took raw data from kaggle and analyzed it using python libraries like numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas etc. then visualized it.

"House Sale Prediction": 
                         I took raw data from kaggle and used different python libraries like numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, sklearn etc. And with the help
                         of these libraries I was able to analyze this raw data into meaningful data and then after describing that data, I visualized it on different plots. 
                         By which people will be able to sort that house which will be best not only in monetary terms but also requirement wise.
